# Changelog

All notable changes to BEYOND are recorded here, newest first.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Phase 1: project setup.** Git repository, Python 3.14 virtual environment, folder layout, README with the
  project pitch, this changelog, `.gitignore` (the `data` folder with your settings and chats is never committed).
- `beyond.py` starts a small web server (FastAPI + Uvicorn) showing a placeholder page on **port 7770**, reachable
  only from this PC by default. Before starting, it checks the port is free; if not, it names the program using it
  and how to fix it, instead of crashing.
- `app/config.py` holds the fresh-install defaults and is the only place port numbers are defined.
- `/api/health` reports that BEYOND is running, its version and phase.
- Planning documents moved into `planning/`.
